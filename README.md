# MNIST Classification with PyTorch Lightning 

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/). It demonstrates a clean, modular deep learning workflow with reproducible training, validation, and testing.

Highlights
- Achieved **98.7% test accuracy** on handwritten digit classification
- Built with **PyTorch Lightning** for scalable and readable training loops
- Includes **EarlyStopping**, metric logging, and modular architecture
- Uses **torchmetrics** for clean accuracy tracking
